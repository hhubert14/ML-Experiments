# ML Experiments

A collection of machine learning experiments and implementations across various domains.

## Projects

### Neural Network from Scratch
Implementation of a neural network from scratch using NumPy, trained on a student performance dataset to predict grade classes.

### Sentiment Classification
Fine-tuning DeBERTa-v3-small for emotion classification using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

### Facial Recognition
Implementation of a Siamese Neural Network for facial recognition using the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset.

### DNCnn Reimplementation
Reimplementation of the DnCNN (Denoising Convolutional Neural Network) for image denoising.

### Fine-tuning Gemma Models for Chess
Fine-tuning Google's Gemma 2B model using LoRA to explain chess moves based on FEN positions.
